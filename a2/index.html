     	<p>The eldest child of Bob and Helen Parr (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl), Violet was born with the superhuman ability to render herself invisible, as well as generate force fields. Violet is a shy high school student who longs to fit in among her peers, a task she believes is hindered by her superpowers. Despite this, Violet has gradually matured and become more confident in herself as both a young woman and superhero.</p>
